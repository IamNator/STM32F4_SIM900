This project uses the STM32F4 Discovery to communicate
with the SIM900 GSM module (with a built in sim card slot).

In order to work this module needs a very robust power supply.
It can draw up to 2A of power in short bursts (if your module
is reseting when you plug in a SIM card - then you probably
have a bad power supply). The wires from the regulator (I use about 3.7V)
to the module should be as short as possible and there has to be 
at least a 100uF electrolyte capacitor at the regulator's output.

Apart from the supply pins, you only need 3 line to communicate with
the module:
- VBAT - power supply
- GND - power supply ground
- RX
- TX
- PWRKEY (turns the module on/off).

Warning: RX and TX work at 2.8V - do not exceed this voltage or
you may damage your module!
Connect your TX line to SIM900_RX through a voltage divider and SIM900_TX
to your RX through a transistor switch (warning: the current
drawn by each digital pin cannot draw more than 10mA, so you
can use for example 4.7k as the base resistor). (Actually, you can
connect SIM900_TX directly to your RX on 3.3V uC like STM32 - 
they will recognize a high state on 2.8V).

PWRKEY connections (see page 24 of SIM900_Hardware Design): 
Connect a 1k resistor to PWRKEY. The other end of the resitor
goes to the collector of an NPN transistor switch.
Drive the base of the switch from your uC through a 4.7k resistor.
You can pull-down the base through a 47k resistor to GND to avoid any
undefined states at startup.
PWRKEY should be pulled low for at least 1s to turn the module
ON/OFF.

To turn off echo mode permanently you have to issue the following
command: "ATE0&W", which writes this setting to nonvolatile memory.
